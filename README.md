# SMA-Q2-Firmware-2
SMA-Q2 Firmware based on the Sandeep Mistry Arduino Core or its implementation in Aaron Christophel's portable Arduino IDE as explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gjmEdEDJ5A&t=751s

The repository contains the sketch with all drivers that are required, as well as the boards.txt which is supposed to replace the old one. The SMA-Q2 variant is also included and can be added easily.
