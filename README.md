# SMA-Q2-Firmware-2
SMA-Q2 Firmware based on the Sandeep Mistry Arduino Core or its implementation in Aaron Christophel's portable Arduino IDE as explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gjmEdEDJ5A&t=751s

The sketch folder SMA-Q2_FW2 contains the sketch with all drivers that are required, as well as the boards.txt which is supposed to replace the old one inside the 0.6.0 folder. The SMA-Q2 variant folder is also included and can be added to the variants folder.
